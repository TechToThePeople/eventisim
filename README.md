Improves the event screens of civicrm. 

The list of participants is optimised to increase entropy and remove redondant information. 

For instance, it when you list the participants of an event, it removes the event name column, as it obviously always contains the name of the event. 

As a rule, if a column always contain the same values, it's removed (eg an event without fee won't have money related columns)
